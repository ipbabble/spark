## Rationale

The goal for this pattern is to:

* Demonstrate a Spark based application on the validated pattern framework.
* Use a GitOps approach to manage hybrid and multi-cloud deployments across both public and private clouds.
* Enable cross-cluster governance and application lifecycle management.
* Securely manage secrets across the deployment.
